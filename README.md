The use of this web page aims to meet all the expectations of our customers. It is extremely easy to control and use.
In the first compartment in the sidebar is reading data from Firebase. Here our customers can find all the cards or products created by them so far. In this compartment, they have the possibility to edit the product if they want. All fields must be completed. <br/>
In the next section, our customer can create a product as he wants. All his data will be stored in the Firebase database. Here he will select the desired image, the type of shoes he or she **will** create, the model of the shoe, its price, and finally the description of the product in detail. When they have finished creating this card, the customer must click on the `"add product"` button. From this moment the automatic product is saved in the database, plus it can be read in the `"Read"` compartment.. <br/>
The next option and function of this project is to allow each client to update the product created. They can access this service either from the reading page or from the sidebar. All changes will take place from the moment you click the `"update product"` button. <br/>
The fourth opportunity offered to our customers is to delete the product created. All deleted cards cannot be recovered, so please use this service with a final decision. Moreover, this page can be accessed as a refresh page, either from the reading page or from the side menu.
